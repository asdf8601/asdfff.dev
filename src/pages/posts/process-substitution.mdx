### diff two variables

```bash
VAR1="hello"
VAR2="helllo"
diff -u <(echo "$VAR1") <(echo "$VAR2")

# output:

### print two sequences side by side

```bash
paste <(seq 1 5) <(seq 6 10)

# output:
1	6
2	7
3	8
4	9
5	10

```


### read in temp file

```bash
less < <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdf8601/asdfff.dev/main/README.md)

```

### redirect output to a process

```bash
echo "hello world" > >(tr a-z A-Z)

# output:
HELLO WORLD
```

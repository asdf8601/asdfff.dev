  > This view of emotions lays emphasis on desires as the root cause of emotional > upheavals. >
  They are seen as modification of desire and attachment. > The desires are seen as arising from the
  contact and attachment of the ego or > ahamkara with the external world and are caused by a sense
  of imperfection, > incompleteness or non-fulfillment.

> All emotions spring from desires and desire is caused by a sense of
> imperfection, incompleteness or non-fulfillment felt within oneself. The
> stronger the desire, the stronger would be the emotional experience.

> Emotions are basically seen as virtue but allowing them to interfere with
> one's judgment and awareness is considered a weakness.
> Emotions are seen as modification of desire or attachment. It is suggested
> that if one wants to overcome the overwhelming emotional experiences like
> anger and sorrow, one must locate the desire underlying it and then eliminate
> it.

> According to Patanjali's Yoga Shastra, suffering is due to ignorance about
> one's true “Self” (avidya). Ignorance leads to misperception. Individuals
> develop a false sense of ego by identifying themselves with things/objects
> around them. The desires, with this ego attachment, become stronger. This ego
> attachment, attraction, and repulsion are termed affliction (Klesas). The
> misperception lies in the acceptance of external objects as the true self.
> This produces a false view of reality. In this sense, suffering/dukha arises
> from within and not from the outside world.

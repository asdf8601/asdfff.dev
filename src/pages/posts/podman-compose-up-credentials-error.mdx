# podman compose up credentials error

If you, like me, have run into this error:

```bash
$ podman compose up --build
WARN[0000] Docker Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildkit isn't enabled
[+] Running 0/1
 ⠋ Service web  Building                                                                                                                                  0.1s
error listing credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in $PATH, out: ``
Error: executing /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build: exit status 1
```

The fix is to correct a typo in `~/.docker/config.json`:

```diff
  {
-  "credsStore": "desktop",
+  "credStore": "desktop",
  }
```

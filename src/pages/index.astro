    <p>
      Documentation is the bridge between your code and those who need to use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet we skip it. We assume it's obvious. We believe "the code is self-documenting."
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not.
    </p>

    <h2>why it fails</h2>
    
    <p>
      Most documentation fails because it doesn't exist or targets the wrong audience.
      You can't help if you don't know what they need.
    </p>

    <h2>how to do better</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Start with basics:</strong> What does it do? How to install? How to run?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Show, don't tell:</strong> Code examples beat abstract theory.
    </p>

    <pre><code>$ npm install your-package
$ your-package --help</code></pre>

    <p>
      <strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Plain language. Short sentences. Easy to scan.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Maintain it:</strong> Outdated docs are worse than no docs.
    </p>

    <h2>stop procrastinating</h2>
    
    <p>
      Write the fucking manual.

    <h1>about</h1>
    
    <p>
      This site exists for one reason: to remind you that documentation matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      No frameworks. No tracking. No bullshit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just plain text on a black screen, like a terminal should be.
    </p>

    <h2>why this exists</h2>
    
    <p>
      Because too many projects die in obscurity not from bad code, but from bad docs.
      Because "just read the source" is not an answer.
      Because your future self will thank you.
    </p>

    <h2>what to do</h2>

    <p>
      Write clear installation instructions.
      Provide working examples.
      Explain the why, not just the what.
      Keep it updated.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's it. That's the manual.
    </p>
